Finally you can have red arrows in RoboFont too.

When the extension is active, red arrows will point to possible mistakes in your outlines.

These kinds of errors are detected:

* Missing extremum points
* Fractional coordinates
* Fractional transformations
* Incorrect smooth connections
* Empty segments
* Collinear vectors
* Semi-horizontal and semi-vertical lines
* Segments on "closepath"
* Zero handles
