RedArrow
========

Finally you can have red arrows in RoboFont too

This is a very rudimentary version which only shows extremum point errors. It is not interactive yet, which means the red arrows keep their position until you press the clear/show buttons again. The outline is only analyzed when you press the "Show red arrows" button.

Also, the arrow marks the offending control point and not yet the point on the curve where the extremum point should be.

The RoboFab pen is mightier than the sword!
